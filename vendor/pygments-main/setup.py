"""Pygments
    ~~~~~~~~

    Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.

    It is a generic syntax highlighter suitable for use in code hosting, forums,
    wikis or other applications that need to prettify source code.  Highlights
    are:

    * a wide range of over 300 languages and other text formats is supported
    * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
    * support for new languages and formats are added easily
    * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image \
      formats that PIL supports and ANSI sequences
    * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
