- suggested new lexers
  * IPython sessions
  * PostgreSQL/SQLite
  * Nemerle

- lexers that need work:
  * review perl lexer (numerous bugs, but so far no one had complaints ;)
  * readd property support for C# lexer? that is, find a regex that doesn't
    backtrack to death...
  * add support for function name highlighting to C++ lexer

- allow "overlay" token types to highlight specials: nth line, a word etc.

- pygmentize option presets, more sophisticated method to output styles?
